in this project i intend to demostrate the different results obtained by training a logistic regression model with unscaled, scaled, unbalanced and balanced data.
This is very important when determining what you are willing to allow when performing a confusion matrix, whether you allow more false positives or false negatives.
And how scaling or not scaling the data affect the strength of each variable.
all the metrics evaluated are available for you to draw conclusions about what is the best approach for your problem.
